// filter by genres , age , categories not working properly
/filtes by watches etc.


//NOTES 
// Updated_at timestamp of movie struct works not on everything(add posters , add genres)
//can add episode number not structered (multiple episode on number on the same number)
//can add season number not structered (multiple seasons on number on the same number)
// ? movie search and simular movies searches movie by keywords, and it works only if keywords have spaces after ","  if like this -> "thiriller,drama" will not work.
// adding large number on CRUD opreations will give 500 error, need to fix
// fix episode docs, not needed struct used
